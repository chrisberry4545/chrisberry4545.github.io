Building apps which let users customize products with their own imagery and buy them, or sell them to others.
Some of the projects I worked on include:

- A white label [web application](https://catalog.kite.ly/) for ordering items such as clothing or wall art
- A white label app for creating [photo books](https://photobook.kite.ly/) online.
- [Shopify App](https://apps.shopify.com/kite-shopify-plugin?surface_detail=kite&surface_inter_position=1&surface_intra_position=1&surface_type=search) so brands can easily create and sell merchandise
