While browsing Netflix I often found myself switching between Netflix and review
sites to decide whether I wanted to watch a piece of content.

While on Netflix's site, this chrome extension will look up the current IMDB rating
of any movie or tv show you are hovering over. The score is put in the top right of
the screen.
